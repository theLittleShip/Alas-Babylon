Ruled by beings beyond our wildest dreams, the Plains saw eras of war and eras of peace. Peace it was when four princes of the Plains agreed to come together and create.\nSoarkos, first, of air and sky, pushed back the yawning deep that filled the space between, to make room for that which others would make next.\nShenlo, then, of water and seas, gave shape to the world, filling it with her own and defining its borders.\nFiroas, next, of fire and stone, carved the land that all would walk and live, before ascending to keep watch, his Eye bringing light to all below.\nMorrain, last, of earth and tree, spread his mind over all the land, bringing green things to sprout and grow.\nAnd as the world finished it's creation, the Great Dragons gave it guardians. Soarkos birthed the Four Winds. Firoas birthed the Stars. And Morrain birthed the dragons of the hills and rivers, the forests and fields.\nAnd when the Four had finished their work, peoples came from the Elemental Plains to populate this new world. But Soarkos decided that this world needed a people of its own, and so created the humans. Then, the Great Dragons departed back to their Plains, to watch over this new world, and see what became of it.\nAnd so began, the First Spring.
